# Introduction

### What

This project is intended to track the drop rate of classes at University of Toronto St. George Campus.

User can access the **list of most and least dropped classes**, as well as the historical enrolment of a class over the course of a semester.

Hosted at http://node-express-env.eba-ztwfmcgs.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/

### Why

Difficulty of a class can be hard to gauge. One of the biggest problem facing UofT students is that there are no readily available data of how hard a class is, except by word of mouth.

This application attempts to compile the list of most dropped course by **tracking daily enrolment** through the official website.
